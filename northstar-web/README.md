# 📦 Northstar API

A Node.js + Express + TypeScript backend built with a feature-first architecture inspired by Bulletproof React principles (applied to backend structure).

## 🧠 Architecture Philosophy

This backend follows a modular, feature-based structure:

Each domain feature owns its routes, controllers, services, and types.

Instead of organizing by technical layers globally (controllers/services), logic is grouped by business feature.
```zsh
🏗️ Project Structure
src/
│
├── db/                  # Database connection + ORM setup
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── schema.ts
│
├── features/           # Feature modules (core architecture)
│   └── users/
│       ├── api/        # Request handlers / route definitions
│       ├── services/   # Business logic
│       ├── types/      # TypeScript types
│       └── validators/ # Request validation (Zod)
│
├── middleware/         # Global middleware (auth, error handling)
├── utils/              # Shared utilities
└── index.ts            # App entry point
```

## 🧩 Core Design Principles
1. Feature-first organization

Each feature is self-contained:

```zsh
features/users/

```

A feature owns:

- routes / API layer
- business logic
- types
- validation rules

---

2. Separation of concerns

Instead of mixing everything in routes:

- api/ → request handling
- services/ → business logic
- db/ → database operations
- validators/ → input validation

---

3. Backend scalability mindset

This structure is designed for:

- easy feature expansion
- isolated logic changes
- team scalability
- clean API boundaries

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM
- Zod (validation)

---

## 🔌 API Design (Example: Users Feature)
```zsh
GET    /users
POST   /users
GET    /users/:id
DELETE /users/:id
```
Each endpoint is implemented inside:

`features/users/`

---

## 🧱 Example Feature Structure (Users)
```zsh
features/users/
├── api/
│   └── users.routes.ts
├── services/
│   └── users.service.ts
├── types/
│   └── users.types.ts
├── validators/
│   └── users.schema.ts
```

## 🔄 Data Flow
Request → Route → Validator → Service → DB → Response

This keeps logic predictable and testable.

## 🧪 Current Focus
Building users feature end-to-end
Connecting Express → Drizzle → PostgreSQL
Establishing clean feature boundaries

## 🚀 Why this structure

This is inspired by Bulletproof React, adapted for backend:

avoids “god files” (big controllers/services)
scales per feature instead of per layer
improves maintainability
mirrors real production codebases


## 📌 Status
Phase: Initial architecture setup
Focus: Users feature (CRUD + DB integration)
